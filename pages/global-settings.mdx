  Global settings in LinkDrop are a vital component of the application, as they
  contain critical information about your brand that is displayed throughout the
  application. These settings include details such as the app name, app
  description, app logo, and app copyright, and they are displayed across the
  entire application. By default, LinkDrop comes with demo information in these
  settings, but it is essential to customize these details to reflect your
  brand's personality and style. By changing the global settings to your
  specific requirements, you can ensure that your brand is accurately
  represented across the entire application. This makes it easier for your
  audience to recognize and engage with your brand, ultimately leading to better
  engagement and results for your business.
