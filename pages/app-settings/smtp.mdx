### Overview

<p className="my-4">
  SMTP settings are important for any application that requires sending out
  email notifications or alerts. In your app, you can configure SMTP settings to
  ensure that emails are delivered successfully. By providing accurate SMTP
  settings, your application can authenticate and establish a secure connection
  with the email service provider, making it easier to send out emails reliably.
  Additionally, you can configure other settings such as email encryption, port
  numbers, and message throttling to further customize your SMTP settings
  according to your needs. Overall, proper SMTP settings can help ensure that
  your application's emails are delivered successfully and enhance the user.

  If you don't set up SMTP then when a user tries to register by email then
  email verification mail will not sent to verify their email. It means new user
  registration will not work without an SMTP setup. So it is very very important
  and one of the most required settings for your application. So you must have
  to setup this setting to enable new user registration of your app.
