### Overview

<p className="mt-4">
  Here you will see the all-created pricing plan list. Also, you can create a
  new pricing plan. Creating subscription plans is an essential step in setting
  up your application, as it enables you to offer different pricing options to
  your users based on their needs. To create subscription plans, you can
  navigate to the Pricing Management page in your application and click on the
  `Create New Plan` button.

  This will take you to the New Subscription creation page, where you can
  specify details such as the plan name, description, price, and duration. You
  can also customize other settings such as the trial period, recurring billing,
  and available features for each subscription plan.

  By creating multiple subscription plans, you can cater to the needs of
  different user groups and provide a range of pricing options that suit their
  budgets and requirements. Proper subscription management can help you retain
  customers, increase revenue, and grow your business. Therefore, it is
  essential to ensure that your subscription plans are created accurately and
  maintained effectively.

### Plan Update

<p className="my-4">
  If you want to update any created plan you can do it easily. Go to the pricing
  plan page where you will see all of your created plans. From here you can go
  to the edit plan page by clicking the "Edit Plan" button.
</p>

> **Important Note** When you create a plan in that case plan price will be USD for global calculation. But when your users want to get a subscription then this USD price will be converted depending on the payment gateway. Suppose I am the user of your app. Now I want to get a premium subscription and select a plan. The plan price is 10 USD. After selecting the plan I will go to the checkout page. From there, I have selected Paystack. Now 10 USD will convert here to Paystack currency like NGN.
