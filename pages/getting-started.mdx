### Installation

**Step 1:** Upload Project In Your Server.

<p>
  To install LinkDrop on your server, you first need to upload the source code.
  This code can be downloaded as a zip file from the LinkDrop website. Once the
  download is complete, you can upload the zip file to your server using a tool
  like FTP. Once the file is uploaded, you can then extract the contents of the
  zip file on your server. This can typically be done using a file manager or
  command-line tools like unzip. With the files extracted, you can then proceed
  to configure and customize LinkDrop according to your needs.
</p>

**Step 2:** Create a .env file

<p>
  After extracting the LinkDrop source code on your server, the next step is to
  create a .env file. This is a simple process, as you will find an .env.example
  file included in the extracted files. To create the .env file, simply make a
  copy of the .env.example file and rename it to .env. Once you have done this,
  you can then edit the file and add your own configurations and settings. The
  .env file is an essential part of the LinkDrop setup, as it contains important
  details such as database credentials, API keys, and other application
  settings. By configuring this file correctly, you can ensure that LinkDrop
  runs smoothly and securely on your server.

### Necessary Setup

<p className="mt-4">**Step 1:** First you need to create database</p>
<p>
  Before you can start using LinkDrop, you will need to create a database to
  store its data. This is an important step in the installation process, as the
  database details will be required to complete the necessary setup.
  Fortunately, creating a database is a simple process and can be done using a
  variety of tools and platforms. If you are unsure of how to create a database,
  you can refer to the video instruction provided by LinkDrop, which will guide
  you through the process step-by-step. The video will cover important details
  such as database name, username, and password, which are all necessary for the
  successful setup of LinkDrop. With your database created and configured, you
  can then proceed to complete the LinkDrop installation and begin using its
  powerful features.
