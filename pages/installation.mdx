### Installation

**Step 1:** Download Source Code.

<p className="flex item-center">
  First, you need to purchase the LinkDrop from
  [codecanyon](https://codecanyon.net/item/linkdrop-saas-link-management-tool/43555815).
  After that, you have to download the source code as a zip file from there.
</p>

**Step 2:** Upload Source Code.

<p>
  To install LinkDrop on your server, you first need to upload the zip file to
  the server where you want to deploy the app. Once the file is uploaded, you
  can then extract the contents of the zip file on your server. This can
  typically be done using a file manager or command-line tools like unzip. With
  the files extracted, you can then proceed to configure and customize LinkDrop
  according to your needs.
</p>

**Step 3:** Create a .env file

<p>
  After extracting the LinkDrop source code on your server, the next step is to
  create a .env file. This is a simple process, as you will find an .env.example
  file included in the extracted files. To create the .env file, simply make a
  copy of the .env.example file and rename it to .env. The .env file is an
  essential part of the LinkDrop setup, as it contains important details such as
  database credentials, API keys, and other application settings. By configuring
  this file correctly, you can ensure that LinkDrop runs smoothly and securely
  on your server. Now you can browse your app by app domain.
</p>

### Necessary Setup

  But before completing other installation processes you will need to create a
  database to store its data. After creating the database you have to collect
  the database name, database user name, and database password. This is an
  important step in the installation process, as the database details will be
  required to complete the necessary setup. With your database created and
  configured, you can then proceed to complete the LinkDrop installation and
  begin using its powerful features.
